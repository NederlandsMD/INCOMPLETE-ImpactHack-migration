# ImpactHack-migration
Visualizing migration. 


## Example -- World Tour
We initially have an index.html (which has the JS inside of it). And we have a capitals.json, which is a geojson. 

### Requirements

We need to start up a local server to run this, since D3 cannot access external data. Either:

<code>http-server</code> if you have node, and http-server installed. Or try

<code>python -m http.server</code>.
