# ImpactHack Refugee Project

This project was created for the WRI/State Department ImpactHack in September 2018. The project involved visualizations of refugee countries of origin and destination over a number of years, as well as factors driving migration trends. The project included a Leaflet map, a D3 rotating globe visualization, several charts (created in plotly), and an embedded youtube video.

My portion of this project was to manipulate the backend data to create the map, including reading in CSVs of refugee countries of origin and destination, slicing the data into top countries of destination for each country of origin, and reading that into a json dictionary to be stored in a mongoDB, then recalled by D3 to create the map with the correct data.

For the prototype of the project, we focused on just 5 countries. This project has not been completed, but its outgrowth can be found in the repository "Project-Uprooted."
